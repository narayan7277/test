Couples can form a more secure bond with one another and be able to have vulnerable conversations without pushing the other person away,” Hsueh says. <br><br>\r\n\r\nEvery partnership has a point of contention. Learning how to resolve disagreements will not only help you resolve your problems but will also strengthen your relationship. <br><br>\r\n\r\nA certified counsellor works with two people in couple’s therapy to help them improve their relationship. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCouples counselling, like any other type of treatment, necessitates both parties' dedication and desire to open up. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMore than 98 percent of people rated marital and family counselling services as satisfactory or excellent, according to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCounselling does not have to be a secretive process confined to only certain \"types\" of people. Couples therapy can benefit everybody in a relationship, regardless of their socioeconomic status. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen going to couples counselling, keep an open mind and be prepared to tear down communication obstacles. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1>Couples therapy techniques at Mpower</h1> <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Listening with intention</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Reflective listening,\" explains Laura Louis, a licensed psychologist at Atlanta Couple Therapy, \"is a tremendously useful exercise where the couple takes turns being active listeners.\" <br><br>\r\n\r\nInstead of using \"you\" sentences, use \"I\" words. Instead of saying \"You're bad for doing X,\" say \"I feel hurt when you do X.\" <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"When partners take turns being active listeners, it improves the couple's communication and conflict resolution skills,\" Louis explains.\r\n\r\n<br><br><strong>2. Psychotherapy with a strong emotional focus</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nEmotionally focused therapy is a technique utilized by many therapists (EFT). <br><br>\r\n\r\nAccording to Ansley Campbell, a clinical director at The Summit Wellness Group, the goal is for couples to \"identify maladaptive patterns within the relationship that are interfering with safe ties and attachments.\" <br><br>\r\n\r\nShe explains that people \"learn and use strategies to repair or develop safe and secure attachments inside the partnership.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><strong>3. The use of narrative therapy</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nNarrative therapy involves people recreating their stories and articulating their difficulties in a narrative format. This can assist them in realizing that no single story can possibly capture the entirety of their experience. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Inconsistencies and contradictions will always exist,\" says Sam Nabil, CEO and main therapist at Naya Clinics. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCouples who believe their relationship is failing because of both of their flaws may benefit from narrative therapy. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"These couples often believe they're in this love quagmire and emotional misery because they've always been a 'failure,' and it's what they 'deserve,\" adds Nabil.\r\n\r\n<br><br><strong>4. The Gottman Technique</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Gottman Method is a well-known technique used by couples’ therapists. The method is intended to assist couples in deepening their understanding of one another while also resolving problems in their relationship. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Gottman Institute has been conducting research for almost 40 years. The Gottman Institute offers live workshops and take-home training materials for couples, but many therapists have also been trained using its methods. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Relationship treatment with Imago</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nDr. Harville Hendrix and Dr. Helen LaKelly Hunt established Imago relationship therapy in 1980, which emphasizes the link between adult relationships and childhood experiences.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe therapy aims to make couples more empathic and understanding of one another by addressing early trauma. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Problem-solving treatment</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nSolution-focused therapy is a paradigm to explore if you're dealing with a specific problem or want to work toward a specific goal. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"A short-term goal-focused evidence-based therapeutic method that helps clients change by developing solutions rather than wallowing,\" according to the Institute for Solution-Focused Therapy. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Exercises and fun activities for couples’ therapy </h1> <br><br>\r\n \r\n<strong>1. Get creative</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen you're having relationship problems, having a physically visible vision board might assist in reminding you of your shared ambitions and goals,” Louis explains. <br><br>\r\n\r\nShe suggests that couples become crafty by writing down goals and collecting images that represent their relationship aspirations. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"It's a concrete reminder that a marriage is a work in progress, and that building a good, healthy, and long-lasting relationship needs hard effort and time on both ends,\" she says. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Look for more in-depth subjects to discuss.</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nGet over the superficial talks and ask your partner more than \"What's for dinner?\"  <br><br>\r\n\r\nKelly Sinning, a registered professional counsellor in Colorado, assigns her clients the task of just conversing with one another as homework. <br><br>br>\r\n\r\n\"We become so caught up in our day-to-day requirements that we don't know we've stopped having conversations about anything else,\" she says.  <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Figure out what your partner's love language is</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nJust because you're in a relationship doesn't guarantee you feel the same way about love. <br><br>\r\n\r\nDr. Gary Chapman's book \"The 5 Love Languages\" has helped couples figure out what makes them feel loved so they can show up for each other. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe five love languages are based on the premise that each person prefers to receive love in one of five different ways: <br><br>\r\n\r\nReceiving presents <br>\r\nPerforming acts of service <br>\r\nReceiving words of affirmation <br>\r\nHaving personal contact <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Fill up your container of intimacy</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nRecognize that you both have intimacy needs as a pair and as individuals. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe \"intimacy bucket,\" as Garcia refers to it, encompasses the following sorts of intimacy: <br><br>\r\n\r\nintellectual\\experiential\\social\\emotional\\sexual <br>\r\nSpend some time in each container looking for exercises. On a Zoom game night, for example, you can try a new pastime together or interact with similar acquaintances. <br><br> \r\n\r\n<strong>5. Do yoga with a partner.</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nConsider doing couples yoga with your significant other. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAs you flow through tandem exercises, partner yoga allows you to balance along with your partner, creating and strengthening trust. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMindfulness was connected to enhanced relationship satisfaction in a 2016 study. Synchronization <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Make a list of things you'd like your partner to do for you.</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nMake a list of three things your partner could do on a weekly basis to make you happy. While looking in each other's eyes, share your list with one another.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe lists may not be something your partner can do every day, but they can help establish trust and communication by reminding them of things they can do once a week.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"The point is that we all display and require affection in different ways,\" explains Nyro Murphy, LCPC. \"Honoring those distinctions is crucial to feeling heard and understood.\" <br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Use an icebreaker to break the ice.</strong> <br><br>\r\n\r\nYou may recall icebreakers from summer camp or work seminars, but this tried-and-true conversation starter could help you rekindle your marriage or relationship.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso read- <a href=\"https://mpowerminds.com/blog/Signs-you-need-couple-counselling-Seek-couple-counselling-in-Bangalore\">https://mpowerminds.com/blog/Signs-you-need-couple-counselling-Seek-couple-counselling-in-Bangalore</a> <br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://mpowerminds.com/blog/Quality-Time-The-Balance-Between-Me-We-How-couples-therapy-work-Mpower-Kolkata\">https://mpowerminds.com/blog/Quality-Time-The-Balance-Between-Me-We-How-couples-therapy-work-Mpower-Kolkata</a>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor couple counselling, you can <a href=\"https://mpowerminds.com/contact\">visit</a> the nearest <a href=\"https://mpowerminds.com/\">Mpower</a> centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
